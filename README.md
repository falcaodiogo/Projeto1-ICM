## Introduction

Developed for the ICM (Introduction to Mobile Computing) class, this project involves creating a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter. Our project, Heart Serious Game (HS Game), is a competitive game utilizing WearOS smartwatches to monitor heart rates, with the data visualized in real-time on a mobile device.

## Project Context

The HS Game leverages the heart rate monitoring capabilities of WearOS smartwatches. Two players compete by maintaining higher average heart rates over the game duration. The game's novelty lies in its use of technology to create an immersive and competitive experience.
